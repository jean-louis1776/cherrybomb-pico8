Cherry Bomb is a basic arcade Shoot 'em up game (Shmup) reminiscent of Space Invaders or Galaga. Pilot your blue spaceship to blast your way through 9 waves of attacking aliens.

## How to Play

Use the following controls:

- Arrow keys - Move the ship
- (X) - Shoot
- (Z) - Bomb (Depletes your üçí. See below)

Shoot the enemies to destroy them. Enemies will attack you. Destroy or avoid all enemies in a wave to proceed to the next wave. There are 9 waves in the game. If you get hit you will lose a ‚ù§Ô∏è. If you lose all ‚ù§Ô∏è you lose the game.

### Pickups

Occasionally, defeated enemies will drop a üçí pickup. Collect them to increase the strength of your Bomb. Triggering the Bomb will deplete your üçí. You cannot use the Bomb if you have no üçí.

If you collect 10 üçí you will restore a ‚ù§Ô∏è. If you already have 4‚ù§Ô∏è you will get points instead. After collecting 10 üçí your stock will always reset.

### Scoring

Here are ways to score in the game:

- Shooting down enemies will give you points. More dangerous enemies will give more points
- Shooting down an attacking enemy will double the points you get
- Collecting 10üçí with 4‚ù§Ô∏è will give you points
- Destroying enemy bullets with the Bomb will give you points

The game will keep your highest score. Post your best results in the comments below!
